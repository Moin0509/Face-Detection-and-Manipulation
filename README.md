# Face-Detection-and-Manipulation

Using the power of OpenCV, I've crafted a dynamic system that goes beyond basic face detection. Here's a sneak peek into what I've achieved:

1️⃣ Face Detection with Haar Cascade Classifier: Implemented a robust face detection system that accurately identifies faces in live video streams.

2️⃣ Live Video Frame Effects: Added a creative touch by drawing interactive rectangles and circles around detected faces, enhancing the visual appeal of the project.

3️⃣ Dynamic Shape Transformation: Introduced a dynamic shape feature where zooming in increases the circle size, creating a playful and interactive user experience. Zoom out, and the circle shrinks back, adapting to the environment in real-time.

4️⃣ Face Cropping and Display: Took it a step further by cropping the detected faces and displaying them in a separate window, providing a closer look at the identified faces.

5️⃣ Live Camera Face Blurring: Implemented face blurring in the live camera feed, ensuring privacy protection while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

6️⃣ Background Blur Effect: Created an innovative background blurring effect that focuses solely on the detected face, emphasizing the subject in the frame.

7️⃣ Image Face Detection: Extended the project to include face detection in images, making it versatile for various applications beyond live video streams.

8️⃣ Face Export Functionality: Developed a function to export just the detected faces into a designated folder, simplifying the process of isolating faces from images.
